# Lucknow Cafe Finder ‚òï

A simple, clean, and user-friendly web application to discover the best cafes in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. This project is built with fundamental front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript) and dynamically loads cafe data from a JSON file.



## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Loading:** Cafe data is fetched from a local `data.json` file, making it easy to update the list.
* **Clean UI:** A modern, card-based layout displays cafes with their image, location, and key features.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on both desktop and mobile.
* **Efficient:** Uses modern JavaScript (`async/await`) for non-blocking data fetching and lazy loading for images to improve performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
* **CSS3:** For styling, using modern features like Grid Layout for a responsive card design.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the logic, including fetching data and dynamically rendering it to the DOM.
